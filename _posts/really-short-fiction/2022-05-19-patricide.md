I’ve aided in the murder of our god.  
Today would’ve been no different from any other Thursday at the Academy but for the events that happened close to its end. I’ve told you before now of my captain and teacher, of his charisma and strength, of his eloquence and intelligence, of how well he speaks the language of our people. (“He even considers it his native tongue!”) I remember your telling me to slow down in my rush to place him on a pedestal. “These people are all the same. You might think otherwise now, but you’ll see that I’m right eventually.” What a tragedy that it has taken the murder of our god and my role in it for me to see!  
We—with me at the forefront, leading the charge beside the man I’d idolized—moved past His guards at the gate, those within the fence, and the few that ran into the villa itself, the last defenders of our Lord. It wasn’t until we had gotten to His bedroom that the gravity of what I was doing (and what I had done in the moments leading up to that) dawned on me. I was complicit in patricide.
